# rest-api-testing
Testing some REST system for LP lessons

## Goals
Trying to set up a Java REST environment to learn how this system works.
We decided to launch something around time. Currently, our goals are :
+ Getting current time on a call
+ Getting time while specifying timezone (Like GMT+X)

## How to try our server

### Environment
Our application has been developed under this configuration. Due to some lack of time, we weren't able to test it under other OS or configs.
 
This app needs the current server configuration to run properly (at least under Linux) :
+ GlassFish 4.1
+ JDK 7
